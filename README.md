# Digitalization-of-district-functions
In the current context of transitioning towards digital administrative services, our project focuses on the digitalization of signature legalization and certified copies in Morocco. Faced with this challenge, our objective is to design and develop an efficient application for the digitization of administrative procedures.

The project aims to meet citizens' expectations in terms of simplicity and speed, while integrating advanced features such as complaint management and facial authentication. Key issues addressed include defining user needs, optimizing administrative processes, and implementing advanced security measures.

The project specifications detail the expected features, such as user management, authentication, request tracking, document management, and communication between the involved parties. The applicationâ€™s functionalities cover various aspects, such as submitting requests, modifying personal data, handling complaints, and facilitating collaborative work among officials.

The functional and non-functional requirements include a user-friendly interface, compliance with regulations, technical support, and regular maintenance. Working as a pair, our task will be to implement these features and ensure the success of this digitalization initiative, thereby providing an optimal user experience while adhering to legal and regulatory standards
