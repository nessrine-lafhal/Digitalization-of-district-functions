# Digitalization-of-district-functions
In the current context of transitioning towards digital administrative services, our project focuses on the digitalization of signature legalization and certified copies in Morocco. Faced with this challenge, our objective is to design and develop an efficient application for the digitization of administrative procedures.

The project aims to meet citizens' expectations in terms of simplicity and speed, while integrating advanced features such as complaint management and facial authentication. Key issues addressed include defining user needs, optimizing administrative processes, and implementing advanced security measures.

The project specifications detail the expected features, such as user management, authentication, request tracking, document management, and communication between the involved parties. The application’s functionalities cover various aspects, such as submitting requests, modifying personal data, handling complaints, and facilitating collaborative work among officials.

The functional and non-functional requirements include a user-friendly interface, compliance with regulations, technical support, and regular maintenance. Working as a pair, our task will be to implement these features and ensure the success of this digitalization initiative, thereby providing an optimal user experience while adhering to legal and regulatory standards

## Introduction
In today’s era of transitioning towards digital public services, this project aims to modernize administrative processes by focusing on the digitalization of signature legalization and certified copies in Morocco. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly, secure, and efficient application that facilitates the submission and management of these procedures for both citizens and officials.

## Spring Framework
### Spring
This project utilizes the Spring framework, which provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for Java applications. Spring’s modularity and flexibility enable easy integration with various components and services.

### Spring Boot
Spring Boot is employed to simplify the development of microservices by offering an embedded server, predefined templates, and auto-configuration features. It helps to quickly bootstrap and develop the application.

### Tools Used
For this project, the following tools and technologies have been utilized:

*  Java: For the core backend logic.
*  Spring Boot: For the application framework.
*  Hibernate: For database management.
*  Thymeleaf: For rendering dynamic web pages.
*  MySQL: As the database for storing user and document information.
*  Maven: For dependency management.
### Project Topic
Problem Statement
In Morocco, the current system for signature legalization and obtaining certified copies is often slow, paper-based, and inconvenient for citizens. Our project aims to address this by designing an application that digitizes these administrative functions, improving efficiency, speed, and accessibility for users.

### Specifications
Functional Requirements:
*  User management (registration, login, and profile management).
*  Document management (submission, verification, and approval of signatures and copies).
*  Complaint handling and tracking.
*  Request tracking for citizens.
*  Collaborative work tools for officials.
*  Secure facial authentication for identity verification.
Non-Functional Requirements:
*  A user-friendly interface that is intuitive for all users.
*  Compliance with government regulations and data privacy laws.
*  Support for real-time complaint management and feedback.
*  Regular maintenance and technical support for users.
### Project Design
#### Use Case and Class Diagrams
Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram illustrates the interactions between the citizens, officials, and the system, showing how requests are submitted, processed, and tracked within the application.

#### Class Diagram
The class diagram provides a structural view of the system, detailing the various classes, their attributes, and relationships to depict the system's architecture.

#### Application Implementation
*  Main Page
The main page of the application provides access to all users. From here, citizens can access their personal spaces, submit requests, and track progress, while administrators can handle approvals and manage the system.

*  Administrator Space (Official)
The administrator space includes tools for officials to manage incoming requests, verify submitted documents, and approve or reject submissions. It also includes collaboration tools for teams.

*  Citizen Space
Citizens can log in to submit their requests for signature legalization and certified copies, track their requests, and file complaints if necessary.

### Conclusion
This project successfully addresses the challenges associated with the current manual process for legalizing signatures and certified copies in Morocco. By leveraging digital tools and technologies, the system streamlines operations, reduces processing time, and improves the overall experience for citizens and officials alike.
